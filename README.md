## 📬 Webhook Testing & Transformation Tool

**Webhook** is a powerful and developer-friendly platform designed to **receive, inspect, transform, and forward** incoming HTTP webhooks. Each user gets a unique endpoint to test integrations from third-party systems or custom applications. The platform supports **customizable transformations**, **resending to target URLs**, and **real-time inspection** through WebSocket notifications.

### ✨ Key Features

* 🔗 **Unique Webhook URLs** for each project or user
* 🛠️ **Payload Transformation Engine** using templating or scripting
* 📤 **Resend Requests** to custom destinations (manual or auto-forward)
* 📈 **Real-Time Dashboard** to view incoming requests
* 🧪 **Test and Debug** webhook integrations easily
* 👥 **Project & User Management** with collaboration support
* 🔔 **Live Notifications** via WebSockets

### 💡 Use Cases

* Test third-party webhooks (e.g., Wave, Stripe, GitHub, Jira)
* Simulate downstream services before they’re available
* Inspect and debug payloads without deploying your backend
<!-- * Build automation workflows triggered by external services -->
