## 📬 Webhook – Modern Webhook Testing & Transformation Platform

**Webhook** is a flexible, developer-centric platform for **capturing, inspecting, transforming, and forwarding** HTTP webhook requests. It allows users to generate **unique endpoints** for each project, making it ideal for testing and debugging third-party integrations or internal systems.

Designed for productivity and observability, Webhook includes built-in support for **real-time monitoring**, **payload transformations**, and **resending mechanisms**—all accessible through an intuitive dashboard with collaboration features.
